Just select the Model you want to install ( Alpaca or Llama, I recommend Alpaca 7B )

and press the big Blue Install button!

### 5. Wait a long time for it to finish
Install can take up to some hours, or just 30 minutes. But it is going to take a long time.

So take a shower or get your coffee until Dalai is installed!

IMPORTANT: If your install crashs or hangs up for any reason, follow the steps in #Troubleshoot!

### 6. Successfully installed
When you get the popup: "Successfully installed", click close.

Now search in your start menu for "Start Dalai" and execute it.

If you can't find "Start Dalai" in the start menu, reboot your Windows machine.

To Stop Dalai, search for "Stop Dalai" and execute that!

Wait some time and open localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Troubleshoot üêû

### 2. Right click Dalaix and press: "Go to folder"

### 3. Right click the Dalaix file in the folder, and press: "Go to location"

### 4. Open CMD with admin rights

### 5. Copy the folder location from the explorer into the CMD

### 6. Hit enter and wait for the error / the last output before freeze.

### 7. Copy the error and post it on the GitHub issue tracker

## How it works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This Software installs Chocolately üç´ ( https://chocolatey.org/ ) on your Windows machine.

Then it executes commands to install all the necessary dependencies for Dalai ( https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/dalai )

After that is finished, it clones Dalai itself and install it.

Then it installs your selected model using commands and creates Start, Stop and Autostart entries.

Thats all the magic üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è behind it!

Happy Hacking, Ben Herbst
