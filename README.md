# Dalaix - "ChatGPT" locally for everyone

## Get Started

## Troubleshoot

## How it works
This Software installs Chocolately ( https://chocolatey.org/ ) on your Windows machine.

Then it executes commands to install all the necessary dependencies for Dalai ( https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/dalai )

After that is finished, it clones Dalai itself and install it.

Then it installs your selected model using commands and creates Start, Stop and Autostart entries.

Thats all the magic behind it!

Happy Hacking, Ben Herbst
